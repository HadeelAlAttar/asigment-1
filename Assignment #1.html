    	<h3>Subjects of study</h3>
    	<p>At the Awesome Science Faculty,we have a pretty open-minded research facilit __ as long as the subjects fall <br> somewhere in the realm of science and technology.You seem like an intelligent,dedicated researcher,and just <br>the kind of person wed like to have on our team.Saying that,of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued <br> by are as follows, in order of priority:</p>
    	<ol type="1">
    		<li>Turning H2O into wine,and the health benefits of Resveratrol(C14H12O3.)</li>
    		<li>Measuring the effect on performance offunk bassplayers at temperatures exceeding 30 C(86 F),when the <br> audience size exponentially increases(effect of 3 x 10^3 increasing to 3 x 10^4.)</li>
    		<li><abbr title="HTML">HTML</abbr> and <abbr title="CSS">CSS</abbr>constructs for representing musical scores.</li>
    	</ol>
    	<p>So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long youd expect the <br>research to take,required staff and other resources,and anything else you think wed need to Know?Thanks. </p>

    	<h3>Exotic dance moves</h3>
    	<p>Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work,I did study exotic tribal dances.To answer your question, <br>
    	my favourite dances are as follows, wuth definitions:</p>
    	<dl>
    		<dt>Polynesian chicken dance</dt>
    		<dd>A little Known but very influential dance dating back as far as 300BC, a whole village would dance around <br>
    		in a circle like chickens,to encourage their livestock to be "fruitful".</dd>
    		<dt>Icelandic brownian shuffle</dt>
    		<dd>Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance, which <br>
    			involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor,and shuffling their bodies around in imperceptibly <br>tiny, very rapid movements.One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspired<br>modern styles such as Twerking. </dd>
    			<dt>Arctic robot dance</dt>
    			<dd>An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in the 1960s believed to have<br>
    				discovered a new dance style characterised by"robotic",stilted movements,being practiced by inhabitants <br>of Northern Alaska and Canada.Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving like this<br>because they were really cold. </dd>
    	</dl>
